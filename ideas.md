- Bugs in production. You are in charge of a software development company. You need to release softwares in order to make money. You can hire developers, QA devs, testers, support.
    - Devs are developing software that will make you gain money, but they generate a lot of bugs. if you have too  many bugs you will loose your customers.
    - Testers will ensure that your software contains less bugs before release.
    - QA devs will fix bugs at the end of the development, just before release.
    - Support will keep your customers happy and will accelerate the finding of bugs.

- Superstar who tries to avoid paparazis. The more he's famous, the more paparazis are after him. 
You will have to buy upgrades for your house, car, etc.. tobe able to avoid paparazis.

- Sanity over magic -> Roguelike. 


## Zombie Madness

On controlle un zombie au debut, le but étant d'infecter la totalité de la ville. Upgrade donc zombies améliorés au fil du temps avec des stats plus puissantes. Deux possibilité, a l'intérieur d'un batiment et a l'exterieur. Possibilité de faire rentrer des zombies dans un batiment pour infecfter le batiment (barre de chargement).
Ou infecter des ppersonnes en ville (cas par cas).
Au fil du temps, la police et le niveau d'alerte montent. Les citoyens évacuent la ville. Lorsqu'il n'y a plus de citoyen, la partie est finie.
